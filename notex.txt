Move code from index.html (from js project) to react's /src/App.js.
Move code from css file to /src/App.css, copy /assets folder to /src folder.
Create /src/getWeather.js, insert code from index.js, add export to each f-n, comment addEventListeners -> you'll need to change them.
Copy utils.js, geoLocation.js.
